Employment income, research grants and investment income are all subject to Canadian income tax. Depending on the amount of money you earned and your eligibility for deductions, you may receive a refund OR have to pay taxes. Even if you did not receive income while in Canada, it is recommended that you complete an income tax return (see next question for more information). If you owe taxes to the government and you do not file your income tax return by the deadline (April 30), you will be charged a late-filing penalty and interest on unpaid amounts.</div>;
