If you file late and owe money to the government, you’ll face both a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your outstanding tax balance. June 15-that’s the filing deadline if you’re self-employed. But if you owe taxes and want to avoid extra charges, you still need to pay up by April 30, like everyone else.</div>;
