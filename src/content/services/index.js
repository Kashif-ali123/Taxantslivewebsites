Plus, there are many reasons to do your taxes every year, even if you don’t have to. If the government owes you a refund, you’ll need to send in a return to get it. Second, the government uses information from your tax forms to determine if you’re eligible for a number of tax rebates and benefits programs such as the GST/HST tax credit and the Canada child benefit. That’s why you should probably file even if you have little or no income.</p>
