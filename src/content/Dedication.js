  return <div style={{marginBottom:"20px"}}>If you’re looking to lower your taxable income and increase your potential for a tax refund, a great place to start may be by looking at the purchases you already make and the bills you already pay each year. You may be surprised to find that some of these everyday purchases and bills are actually tax-deductible. Medical expenses Childcare expenses Unreimbursed work-related expense Self-employment expense Other expenses For self-employed people… If you have lost receipts for expenses. Can you still claim them? Generally, no; you can’t make tax claims without receipts. All of your claimed business expenses on your income tax return need to be supported with original documents, such as receipts. Without the “evidence” of receipts for your claimed business expenses, the Canada Revenue Agency may decide to reduce the amount of expenses you have deducted. (The one exception is meal and vehicle expenses for moving or for northern residents, as described below.) While it’s true that you don’t send your expense receipts into the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) when you file your income tax online, as many of us do nowadays, you’re still expected to have those receipts and be able to produce them when asked. Note that you have to have actual receipts for your business expenses before you can claim them. Many business people make the mistake of thinking that a bank or credit card statement is enough proof of an expense. It’s not. All a bank or credit card statement proves is that a payment was made.</div>;
