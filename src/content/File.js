  return <div style={{marginBottom:"20px"}}>No but if you’re in luck, eager beaver-the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) started processing tax returns on Feb. 26 this year. The No. 1 reason for filing early is that you get your money back faster. But even if you aren’t expecting a refund, there are good reasons to get your taxes done ASAP. If you face a big tax bill, you can set up a plan to pay it in smaller chunks by April 30. The government won’t apply any charges until the tax payment deadline. Even if you can’t pay off the full balance by then, whatever funds the CRA receives from you by then is less money on which you’ll have to pay interest.</div>;
